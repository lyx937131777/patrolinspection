ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* ant.properties
* build.xml
* license.txt
* license_jj2000.txt
* manifest.mf
* proguard.cfg
* signing\
* signing\create-key.bat
* signing\export-certificate.bat
* signing\sign-apk.bat
* source_projects\
* source_projects\ajj2000\
* source_projects\ajj2000\EXTERNALS.TXT
* source_projects\ajj2000\ajj2000-rev_18.zip
* source_projects\exampleimages\
* source_projects\exampleimages\debugimg1.jp2
* source_projects\exampleimages\debugimg2.jp2

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => imageDecoderService\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => imageDecoderService\src\main\assets
* lint.xml => imageDecoderService\lint.xml
* res\ => imageDecoderService\src\main\res\
* src\ => imageDecoderService\src\main\java\
* src\at\mroland\android\imagedecoder\BitmapImage.aidl => imageDecoderService\src\main\aidl\at\mroland\android\imagedecoder\BitmapImage.aidl
* src\at\mroland\android\imagedecoder\IImageDecoderService.aidl => imageDecoderService\src\main\aidl\at\mroland\android\imagedecoder\IImageDecoderService.aidl

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
